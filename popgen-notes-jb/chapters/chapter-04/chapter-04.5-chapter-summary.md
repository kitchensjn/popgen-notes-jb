# Chapter Summary

- Genetic drift is the random change in allele frequencies due to alleles
by chance leaving more or fewer copies of themselves to the next
generation. It is directionless, with alleles equally likely to go up or
down in frequency thanks to drift. Genetic drift occurs at a slower rate
in larger populations as there is a greater degree of averaging in
larger populations that reduces the impact of the randomness in
individuals' reproduction.

- On average genetic drift acts to remove genetic diversity (e.g.
heterozygosity) from the population. The rate at which neutral genetic
diversity is lost from the population is inversely proportional the
population size.

- A balance of mutation and genetic drift can maintain an equilibrium
level of neutral genetic diversity in a population. This equilibrium
level is determined by the population-scaled mutation rate ($N \mu$).

- In practice, genetic drift will rarely occur at the rate suggested by
the census population size, e.g. due to large variance in reproductive
success and short-term population size fluctuations. In many situations,
we can address this by using an effective population size in place of
the census population size. We can estimate this effective population
size by matching our observed rate of genetic drift to that expected in
an idealized population.

- A key insight in thinking about patterns of neutral diversity is to
realize that neutral mutations do not alter the shape of the genetic
tree (or genealogy) relating individuals, and so it is often helpful to
think about the tree first and then think of neutral mutations scattered
on top of this tree.

- Coalescent theory describes the properties of these trees, and the
mutational patterns generated, under a model of neutral evolution.

- Long-term changes in population size alter the rate of coalescence in a
predictable way that impacts patterns of variation. These patterns can
be used to detect violations of a constant population model and to
estimate more complex demographic models.
