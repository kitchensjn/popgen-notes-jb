# Genetic Drift and Neutral Diversity

:::{margin}
{cite:t}`fisher1923xxi` also discusses models related to genetic drift, but {cite:t}`wright1931evolution`'s treatment is more extensive and he uses the name 'drift'. Both {cite:t}`wright1931evolution` and {cite:t}`fisher1923xxi` credit earlier authors {cite:p}`gulick1873diversity;Hagedoorn` with the intuition behind the concept of genetic drift.

*RANDOMNESS IS INHERENT TO EVOLUTION*, from the lucky birds blown off course to colonize some new oceanic island, to which mutations arise first in the HIV strain infecting an individual taking anti-retroviral drugs. One major source of stochasticity in evolutionary biology is genetic drift. Genetic drift occurs because more or less copies of an allele by chance can be transmitted to the next generation {cite:p}`wright1931evolution`. This can occur because, by chance, the individuals carrying a particular allele can leave more or less offspring in the next generation. In a sexual population, genetic drift also occurs because Mendelian transmission means that only one of the two alleles in an individual, chosen at random at a locus, is transmitted to the offspring.

Genetic drift can play a role in the dynamics of all alleles in all populations, but it will play the biggest role for neutral alleles. A neutral polymorphism occurs when the segregating alleles at a polymorphic site have no discernible differences in their effect on fitness. We'll make clear what we mean by "discernible" later, but for the moment think of this as "no effect" on fitness.

### The neutral theory of molecular evolution.

The role of genetic drift in molecular evolution has been hotly debated since the 60s when the Neutral theory of molecular evolution was proposed (see {cite:t}`ohta1996development` for a history). The central premise of Neutral theory is that patterns of molecular polymorphism within species and substitution between species can be well understood by supposing that the vast majority of these molecular polymorphisms and substitutions were neutral alleles, whose dynamics were just subject to the vagaries of genetic drift and mutation. Early proponents of this view suggested that the vast majority of new mutations are either neutral or highly deleterious (e.g. mutations that disrupt important protein functions). This latter class of mutations are too deleterious to contribute much to common polymorphisms or substitutions between species, because they are quickly weeded out of the population by selection.

Neutral theory can sound strange given that much of the time our first brush with evolution often focuses on adaptation and phenotypic evolution. However, proponents of this world-view didn't deny the existence of advantageous mutations, they simply thought that beneficial mutations are rare enough that their contribution to the bulk of polymorphism or divergence can be largely ignored. They also often thought that much of phenotypic evolution may well be adaptive, but again the loci responsible for these phenotypes are a small fraction of all the molecular change that occur. The neutral theory of molecular evolution was originally proposed to explain protein polymorphism. However, we can apply it more broadly to think about neutral evolution genome-wide. With that in mind, what types of molecular changes could be neutral? Perhaps:

1. Changes in non-coding DNA that don't disrupt regulatory sequences. For example, in the human genome only about 2% of the genome codes for proteins. The rest is mostly made up of old transposable element and retrovirus insertions, repeats, pseudo-genes, and general genomic clutter. Current estimates suggest that, even counting conserved, functional, non-coding regions, less than 10% of our genome is subject to evolutionary constraint {cite:p}`rands:14`.

2. Synonymous changes in coding regions, i.e. those that don't change the amino-acid encoded by a codon.

3. Non-synonymous changes that don't have a strong effect on the functional properties of the amino acid encoded, e.g. changes that don't change the size, charge, or hydrophobic properties of the amino acid too much.

4. An amino-acid change with phenotypic consequences, but little relevance to fitness, e.g. a mutation that causes your ears to be a slightly different shape, or that prevents an organism from living past 50 in a species where most individuals reproduce and die by their 20s.

There are counter examples to all of these ideas, e.g. synonymous changes can affect the translation speed and accuracy of proteins and so are subject to selection. However, the list above hopefully convinces you that the general thinking that some portion of molecular change may not be subject to selection isn't as daft as it may have initially sounded.

Various features of molecular polymorphism and divergence have been viewed as consistent with the neutral theory of molecular evolution. In this chapter we'll focus on the prediction of a high level of molecular polymorphism in many species (see for example {numref}`figure-2.3`). In a subsequent chapter we'll talk about the prediction of a molecular clock. We'll see that various aspects of the original neutral theory have merit in describing some features and types of molecular change, but we'll also see that it is demonstrably wrong in some cases. We'll also see the primary utility of the neutral theory isn't whether it is right or wrong, but that it serves as a simple null model that can be tested and in some cases rejected, and subsequently built on. The broader debate currently in the field of molecular evolution is the balance of neutral, adaptive, and deleterious changes that drive different types of evolutionary change.
