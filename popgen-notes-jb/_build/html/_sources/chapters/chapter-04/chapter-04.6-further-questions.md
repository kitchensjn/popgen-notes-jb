:::{admonition} Question 12
:name: question-4.12
Based on museum samples from $\sim 1800$, you estimate that the average
heterozygosity in Northern Elephant Seals was $0.0304$ across many loci.
Based on further samples, you estimate that in $1960$ this had dropped
to $0.011$. Elephant Seals have a generation time of $8$ years.\
What effective population size do you estimate is consistent with this
drop?

:::{admonition} Question 13
:name: question-4.13
**A)** Why are large populations expected to harbor more neutral
variation?\
**B)** What is the effective population size? Is it usually higher or
lower than the census population size?\
**C)** Why does the effective population size differ across the
autosomes, Y chromosome, and mtDNA?

:::{admonition} Question 14
:name: question-4.14
You sequence a genomic region of a species of Baboon. Out of 100
thousand basepairs, on average, 200 differ between each pair of
sequences. Assume a per base mutation rate of $1 \times 10^{-8}$ and a
generation time of ten years.\
**A)** What is the effective population size of these Baboons?\
**B)** What is the average coalescent time (in years) of a pair of
sequences in this species?
