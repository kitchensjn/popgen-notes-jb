:::{admonition} Question 11
:name: question-2.11

Calculate $r_{0}$, $r_{1}$, $r_{2}$ and the coefficient of kinship $F$
between:

- **A)** A grandparent and their grandchild
- **B)** A great grandparent and their great grandchild

:::{admonition} Question 12
:name: question-2.12

You are studying a codominant flower colour polymorphism. Skipping
through a meadow of flowers you and compile the following data:

<center>
<div style="width: 50%;">

| red | pink | white |
| :-: | :--: | :---: |
| 200 | 100  | 200   |

</div>

- **A)** What frequencies would you expect at this locus under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?
- **B)** Calculate the inbreeding coefficient at this locus.
- **C)** Name two distinct processes that could lead to the deviation you see, and describe how they would result in a deficit of heterozygotes.

:::{admonition} Question 13
:name: question-2.13

What are the relatedness coefficients of the X chromosome between:

- **A)** Two male full siblings?
- **B)** Two female full siblings?
- **C)** What is the probability that a female offspring of a full sib mating is homozygous by descent at a locus on her X chromosome?

:::{admonition} Question 14
:name: question-2.14

You are studying the wing spot polymorphism in a butterfly species. From crosses in the lab you find that the presence of wing spots is determined by a dominant allele.

You collect 100 butterflies, 84 of them have the wing spots. What is the frequency of the wing-spot allele? What assumption did you have to make to come to your answer?
:::

:::{admonition} Question 15
:name: question-2.15

An allele has frequency of $0.001$ in the population. What is the probability that both you and your first (full) cousin are heterozygote for the allele?
:::

:::{admonition} Question 16
:name: question-2.16

The kinship coefficient of the parents is the inbreeding coefficient of the offspring. Explain, with reference to the weighting of relatedness coefficients in the inbreeding coefficient, why the inbreeding coefficient is the probability that a locus is homozygous by descent.
:::

:::{admonition} Question 17
:name: question-2.17

In terms of identity by descent, explain why multiple inbreeding loops in an individual's pedigree lead to higher levels of inbreeding.
