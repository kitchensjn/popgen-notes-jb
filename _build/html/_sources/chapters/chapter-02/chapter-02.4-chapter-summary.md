# Chapter Summary

- This chapter developed the relationship between allele frequencies and genotype frequencies within a generation and among relatives.
- Under random mating, we derived expectations of the genotype frequencies (Hardy-Weinberg), and we can identify deviations away from these expectations.
- Identity by descent (IBD) refers to the sharing of alleles due to a recent shared biological relationship.
- We can predict the probability and expected level of sharing of alleles IBD among pairs of relatives using mendelian transmission probabilities (as contained in coefficients $r_0$, $r_1$, and $r_2$). One useful summary of relatedness for a pair of individuals is the kinship coefficient $F_{i,j}$.
- We can also learn about genetic relationships from the sharing of genomic segments among relatives, with many long shared segments revealing a closer relationship.
- An inbred individual has parents who are more closely related than random draws from some reference population.
- Inbreeding results in decreased heterozygosity and a complementary increase in homozygosity. We can use the kinship coefficient of the parents to estimate the distortion away from Hardy-Weinberg and the expected level of heterozygosity.
- Inbreeding coefficients can be calculated from genetic data, either for multiple individuals at a single locus or for multiple loci for a single individual.
