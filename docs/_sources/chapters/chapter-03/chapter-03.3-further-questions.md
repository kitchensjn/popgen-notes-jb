:::{admonition} Question 6
:name: question-3.6

The loss of heterozygosity due to inbreeding can be partitioned across F statistics at multiple levels. For example we can partition the total inbreeding coefficient of a individuals ($F_{IT}$) compared to a population between $F_{IS}$ and $F_{ST}$. For the following example scenarios, do you expect $F_{IS}$ to be larger or smaller than $F_{ST}$? Explain your answer.

**A)** Charles II, where the subpopulation is Spain and the total
population is Europeans.

**B)** Subpopulations of plants living on a moutainside, where pollen disperses long distances via wind, butindividuals self-pollinate about 50% of the time.

**C)** Fish that live in lakes with very few accessible waterways
between lakes, but where the fish swim freely within lakes. Each lake is a subpopulation and the entire lake basin is the total population.

:::{admonition} Question 7
:name: question-3.7

In a species of beetle, the colour and shape of the wings are controlled by two distinct polymorphisms (with alleles big/small and red/yellow respectively). In a museum collection you estimate the frequency of the four haplotypes to be:

| big/red | big/yellow | small/red | small/yellow |
| :-----: | :--------: | :-------: | :----------: |
| 0.69    | 0.00       | 0.09      | 0.22         |

This collection is from 60 years ago. In present day populations you estimate the frequencies of the haplotypes to be:

| 0.5452 | 0.1448 | 0.2348 | 0.0752 |

**A)** Assuming one generation per year, what is the recombination fraction between these loci?

**B)** Qualitatively, how would your answer change if you determined that crossing over only occurred in females and not in males?
